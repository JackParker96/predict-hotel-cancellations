# Kaggle Competition: Predict Hotel Cancellations

In the spring of 2023, I participated in a within-class Kaggle competition where the goal was to predict whether or not a party would cancel their hotel reservation based on various predictive features.

I used K-nearest neighbors to impute missing data, normalized each feature, and then compared the performance of a random forest classifier and boosted decision trees. I tuned the parameters for both models using random search.

The hyperparameter-tuned random forest classifier achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.956.
